# Intraday-Trading-Strategy
This project focuses on developing an intraday trading strategy using the GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model to predict volatility. By integrating daily and intraday data, we aim to generate trading signals and calculate strategy returns.

# Steps Overview
1. Load Daily and 5-Minute Data
First, we load the simulated daily data and intraday 5-minute data. This data serves as the foundation for fitting the GARCH model and generating trading signals.

2. Define Function to Fit GARCH Model and Predict Volatility
We define a function to fit the GARCH model on the daily data. This model is used to predict one-day-ahead volatility in a rolling window. The GARCH model helps us understand and forecast the variability in stock prices, which is crucial for making informed trading decisions.

3. Calculate Prediction Premium and Form Daily Signal
Using the predicted volatility, we calculate a prediction premium. This premium helps us form a daily trading signal, indicating whether we should enter a long or short position based on expected market volatility.

4. Merge with Intraday Data and Calculate Intraday Indicators
We merge the daily signal with the intraday 5-minute data. Then, we calculate various intraday indicators, such as moving averages, volatility, and momentum, to refine our intraday trading signals. These indicators help us make more precise entry and exit decisions during the trading day.

5. Generate Position Entry and Hold Until End of Day
Based on the intraday signals, we generate position entries. Once a position is entered, it is held until the end of the trading day. This approach ensures we capitalize on intraday price movements predicted by the GARCH model and intraday indicators.

6. Calculate Final Strategy Returns
Finally, we calculate the returns of our intraday trading strategy. By comparing these returns to a benchmark or evaluating their standalone performance, we can assess the effectiveness of our strategy.

By following these steps, we can develop an intraday trading strategy that leverages the predictive power of the GARCH model and intraday indicators to make informed trading decisions and potentially achieve superior returns.
